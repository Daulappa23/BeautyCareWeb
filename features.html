<h1 class="fonts"><marquee>Beauty Blog Ideas for Your Social Feed</marquee></h1>
		
<p><b>Whether you have a well-known brand or are trying to break into the market, social media is the first place your consumers will be checking you out. So you've got to get your social game right!

Let’s start with some trends that you shouldn't miss out on:

The age of the informed and empowered consumer
Ingredient transparency and ingredient knowledge are now an unspoken mandate for the beauty and cosmetics industry.
Knowledge is power
Everyone wants to learn how to wear the newest makeup trends, how to use the latest products and how to sound like a makeup pro.
Camera-ready beats party-ready
Now when people get ready for a night, they’re getting ready for some picture-perfect Instagrammin’
Influencers are here to stay
The nature of influencing might change (towards the ethical) but celebrity influencers and micro-influencers with affiliate links are leading sales channels today
Routines are very routine
Almost every woman has a nighttime beauty routine - ambitious ones can go upto half an hour long...and men are catching up too.
More is more
No one runs behind just the basics anymore. Mascara, lipstick, foundation are old news - glow sticks, mists, oils & more are taking makeup time up a notch.<br>

<p><h1>9 in 10 consumers turning to social platforms for beauty products</h1>
<p>The vast majority of global consumers (91%) now preferring to shop for beauty products via social platforms, as just 44% opt to browse for and purchase cosmetics in-store.

Social media platforms are now used by 96% of global internet users, which has only boosted the potential for brands exploring the possibilities of social commerce. Influenster’s research reveals over three quarters (76%) of consumers find themselves ‘very influenced’ to shop via social media, and 73% actively shop the likes of Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Pinterest.

Whether that’s browsing, scrolling for inspiration, or making a purchase, the technologies being used by brands – be it live shopping events, or virtual AR ‘try-on’ or ‘try-out’ experiences – play right into the demands of the beauty buyer and are drawing consumer attention away from high street beauty counters.

The ease with which beauty products can be showcased via social has set it apart. Beauty is the sector to watch in the shift to social commerce, however this trend is also reflected in consumers’ clothing and homeware shopping preferences. 
The majority of consumers (81%) are also now shopping for clothes on social media compared to just 57% in-store, and rising home décor trends means 60% also prefer to shop for the home furnishing on social platforms versus 40% in-store.

In comparison, basic necessities such as food and beverage purchases are still happening predominately in-store (58%) compared to social media (47%). However, shopping for electronics is more finely balanced with 42% of consumers shopping for electronics via social platforms compared to 39% in-store.
<hr color="orange">
<h1>The social media influence</h1>
<p>Be it beauty hacks, travel secrets or home renovation tips, social media users will never be short on new ideas, with almost two thirds (65%) of consumers turning to social platforms for shopping inspiration. This is in part due to the rise of more authentic nano and micro-influencers, with as many consumers shopping based on influencer recommendations and links shared by influencers, as they are from brands they follow (60%).

Brand content does still have a place in social commerce, but influencer recommendations have now become so influential that traditional social media advertising has taken a back seat. Just 28% of consumers now shop from banner ads they’ve seen for products they’ve looked at before, pushing brands to look towards relevant influencers as part of their social media strategy.

Not all influencers are made the same, however, and research from Bazaarvoice revealed that subject matter experts – such as beauty gurus – are viewed as the most trusted by consumers to share authentic and genuine content (39%).
